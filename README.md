# BlockScan - Ethereum Block Explorer

Blockscan gives you the latest blocks and transactions mined on the Ethereum network. You can enter any Ethereum address on the search bar to get the ETH balance in real time. The app also shows the latest Gas price on the network.

The project is made using React + Vite and uses alchemy-sdk and ethers.js library to pull the data from the Ethereum network.
